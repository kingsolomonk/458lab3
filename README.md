# 458lab3: US COVID-19 2020 cases Counts and Rates (County Level)
The purpose of this project is to visualize the spread of COVID-19 cases during 2020 within the US. <br>
The first map provides a choropleth map where each US county is categorized by color based on the number of cases there are per 100,000 people (not specified, so assumed) where a more yellow tone being not that many and dark red as over 100 cases per 100,000 people. The second map provides a proportional symbol map where each circle represents a county and depending on the number of cases, the size increases/decreases, while also the hue of the color darkens. At the very last class of number of cases, the color turns into a bright orange. Both maps are interactive: first map allows for hover functionality, providing more info on the county and second map allows for on-click popups providing info per county.
